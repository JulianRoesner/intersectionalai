# Design Notes for IAI

### What is an *Intersectional AI Toolkit*?

### Why make an IAI TK? 

### Who's making this IAI TK?

### ...and how can I contribute? 

#### 1. expanded reading: github diffs & comments

There are many ways to contribute. One of the most immediate is to join in the co-creation of these texts! Feel free to read along, and add your thoughts on the project's [github archive](https://github.com/sarahciston/tethered).

1. at the bottom of any page on this site, you'll see a link to "Comment, edit, or remix this page on Github." When you follow it, you reach the code for this page and all the files that run this site. 

2. In the blue bar, click the **History** button which will take you into the archives for this particular file. Don't worry you can't break anything. 

3. Here you'll get a list of every **Commit**, AKA each time changes have been saved to the repository). They'll have random names like, "Updated a typo" or "Redid everything FML!!!" because sometimes I'm not good at clearly labeled commits. Click the top link in the list (latest), or rewind to an earlier version if you like. *Follow along with the drama, ghasp!*

4. Now you have a colorful look at every change—green for adds and red for deletes—made to each file. AND when you point your cursor at a line, a blue plus sign appears at the left edge. Click on the blue plus sign to leave a comment! If you're in raw text mode you'll also see other readers' comments as well.
