### Principles & Protocols
#### guidelines for gathering in this space

* scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code[^ccc] #nocodesnobs[^p5]
* growth, not perfection[^ccc] #newKidLove[^p5]
* community, not competition (an open-source attitude)[^ccc]
* we all have skills to teach each other[^ccc] 

* all practice is theory–practice[^ccc]

* we focus on strategies rather than issues, solutions rather than problems[^AMC]
* we spend more time building than attacking[^AMC]
* we emphasize our own power and legitimacy[^AMC]
 
* we value the process as much as, or more than, the outcomes. [^amb]
* assume best intent, attend to impact[^amb]
* confidentiality–take the lessons, leave the details[^amb]
* yes/and, both/and[^amb]
* listen from the inside out, from the bottom up[^amb] (listen from the heart, speak from the heart, be spontaneous, be brief[^Council])
* engage tension, don’t indulge drama[^amb]
* W.A.I.T.—Why Am I Talking[^amb]
* make space, take space—to help balance the verbose and the reticent[^amb]
* we center care[^AMC]—self care and community care[^amb] 

* we meet people where they are. we do not assume knowledge or imply hierarchies of skills. we are not snobs about coding, scholarship, or other forms of knowledge.[^p5]
* we are here to listen and learn from each other; therefore we appreciate and accommodate people’s identities and life experiences, as they are different from ours.
* We are respectful and kind in our speech and actions. We refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.[^BerlinCoC]
* We attempt collaboration before conflict.[^BerlinCoC] Misunderstandings and disagreements do happen. When conflicts arise, we resolve them maintaining courtesy, respect, and dignity, even when emotions are heightened.
* We accept responsibility for our actions and take care to make amends when we are wrong.[^p5]
* We are mindful of our fellow participants and alert community facilitators if we notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if they seem inconsequential.[^W3C] 
* We welcome each co-organizer’s input and we update these guidelines to support the needs of our community as they evolve.
Thank you to the organizations from which these guidelines are drawn: Berlin Code of Conduct, Center for Council, Letters for Black Lives, P5.js, W3C.
