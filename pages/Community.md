### Principles & Protocols
#### guidelines for gathering in this space

* scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code[^ccc] #nocodesnobs[^p5]
* growth, not perfection[^ccc] #newKidLove[^p5]
* collaboration, not competition[^ccc]
* we all have skills to teach each other[^ccc] 
* we meet people where they are. we don't assume knowledge or imply hierarchies of skills. we are not snobs about coding, scholarship, or other forms of knowledge.[^p5]
* we value processes as much as, or more than, outcomes[^amb]
* all theory and practice is theory–practice.[^ccc] interdisciplinary goes hand-in-hand with intersectionality 
* #blacklivesmatter #translivesmatter #indigenouslivesmatter we engage tension; don't indulge drama[^amb] 
* we focus on strategies rather than issues, solutions rather than problems[^AMC]
* listen from the heart, speak from the heart, be spontaneous, be brief[^Council]
* assume best intent and attend to impact[^amb]
* we accept responsibility for our actions and take care to make amends when we are wrong[^p5] 
* we take the lessons, leave the details (confidentiality)[^amb]
* we center care[^AMC]—self care and community care[^amb] 

These guidelines are open to inputs and updates as necessary to support the needs of this space and community as they evolve.
