<!-- ## Intersectional AI Toolkit -->

### a zine collection and code library for artists, activists, engineers, and you

This does not claim to be the first or best resource on intersectionality or AI. Instead, we gather together some of the *amazing* people, ideas, forces working to make technology more ethical and equitable. In the tradition of '90s zine aesthetics and politics, we celebrate these by sharing them--connecting concepts, creators, tools, and tactics across disciplines and counter-histories--hoping to spark further conversation and collaboration. We do this imperfectly and incompletely, showing rough edges and edit marks, in the belief that no text is final and no code cannot be improved.

#### Eight issues, printable as double-sided zines--and readable, remixable, shareable

**1 & 2.** [A-to-Z IAI](posts/Glossary.md)

**3 & 4.** [Who](posts/LoveNotes.md) & [Why](posts/WhyAI.md) IAI

**5 & 6**. [Tactics](posts/Tactics.md) & [Ethics](posts/Caring.md) for IAI

**7 & 8.** [Artists'](posts/NoCode.md) & [Engineers'](posts/Techies.md) Guides to IAI
