## What is an *Intersectional AI Toolkit*?

#### a zine collection and code resource hub for artists, activists, engineers, and you

The Intersectional AI Toolkit gathers ideas, ethics, and tactics for creating and supporting more ethical, equitable tech. It shows how established queer, anti-racist, anti-ableist, feminist communities contribute necessary perspectives to reshaping the digital systems that affect us all. The toolkit also offers approachable guides to both intersectionality and AI. This endeavor works from the hope that code can feel approachable for everyone, can move us toward care and repair—rather than perpetuating power imbalances—and can do so by embodying lessons from intersectionality.

Of course, this toolkit is not the first or only resource on intersectionality or AI. Instead, it gathers together some of the amazing people, ideas, and forces working to re-examine the foundational assumptions built into these technologies, in order to make them more ethical and equitable. In the tradition of '90s zine aesthetics and politics, it celebrates these efforts by sharing them—connecting concepts, creators, tools, and tactics across disciplines and counter-histories—hoping to spark further conversation and collaboration. It does so imperfectly and incrementally, showing rough edges and edit marks, in the belief that no text is final, all code can be forked, and everything is better with friends. 

Please join in by exploring the toolkit, commenting with your questions or thoughts, or remixing it into your own new text(s). No experience is necessary to participate; all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome!

## What's included? 

### Zine collection 

#### The zine collection is planned out as eight issues—printable as double-sided zines—and readable, remixable, shareable. More resources to come!

**1 & 2.** [A-to-Z IAI](posts/Glossary.md)

**3 & 4.** [Who](posts/LoveNotes.md) & [Why](posts/WhyAI.md) IAI

**5 & 6**. [Tactics](posts/Tactics.md) & [Ethics](posts/Caring.md) for IAI

**7 & 8.** [Artists'](posts/NoCode.md) & [Engineers'](posts/Techies.md) Guides to IAI

See [Notes](pages/Notes.md) for more on the making of this collection-in-progress and read below about how you can help it grow.
  
### Code resource hub
  
#### The code resource hub will be an ever-growing community-sourced collection of video tutorials, code libraries, inspiring projects, and so forth, which have been curated by members of [Creative Code Collective] and friends. These will point you to the many different kinds of projects, tools, and research being made around Intersectional AI and related topics. It's fed by a user-friendly spreadsheet where you can add your own resources and tell us why you like them. Get inspired; get cracking making your own!

## Why make an IAI TK? 

## Who's making this IAI TK? 

Developed by Sarah Ciston while a virtual fellow at the HIIG, with valued inspiration and collaboration from many others, listed [ColophonTK]

## ...and how can I contribute? 

#### • joining the discord

#### • keeping an interdisciplinary, intersectional mindset

#### • making github comments, browsing the diffs

There are many ways to contribute. One of the most immediate is to join in the co-creation of these texts! Feel free to read along, and add your thoughts on the project's [github archive](https://github.com/sarahciston/tethered). I think of this as an expanded form of reading-writing.

1. at the bottom of any page on this site, you'll see a link to "Comment, edit, or remix this page on Github." When you follow it, you reach the code for this page and all the files that run this site. 

2. In the blue bar, click the **History** button which will take you into the archives for this particular file. Don't worry you can't break anything. 

3. Here you'll get a list of every **Commit**, AKA each time changes have been saved to the repository). They'll have random names like, "Updated a typo" or "Redid everything FML!!!" because sometimes I'm not good at clearly labeled commits. Click the top link in the list (latest), or rewind to an earlier version if you like. *Follow along with the drama, ghasp!*

4. Now you have a colorful look at every change or "diff"—<span style="color: green">green + for adds</span> and <span style="color: red">red - for deletes</span>—made to each file. AND when you point your cursor at a line, a blue <span style="color: blue; background: lightblue">+</span> plus appears at the left edge, where you can click to leave a comment about that line! If you're in "raw text" mode you'll also see other readers' comments, plus the non-formatted code as well.
