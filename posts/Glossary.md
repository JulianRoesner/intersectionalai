## Intersectional AI A-to-Z 

This glossary of terms for Intersectional AI A-to-Z is a great place to get started. By all means only one attempt at defining these ideas, and an invitation for conversations and amendments, these concepts show the complexity of the topic seen from multiple angles; meanwhile, I argue it's important to try to break down these concepts into plain language in order to offer more openings for folks to join these conversations. Please chime in, ask questions, help make these definitions better!

*[adversarial network]: A type of machine learning often used to generate new data, such as images (GAN = Generative Adversarial Network). It requires two parts: one trained on existing data, and another trying to generate new data that can fool the first part. 
*[adversity]: 
*[bias]: In a machine learning problem, bias is the technical definition for XXXXX. | In social situations, bias occurs XXXXXX.
*[code of conduct]: Usually written together by a group, these guidelines outline expectations for behavior and procedures for when members of a community don't meet those expectations. While some argue for structureless, free-speech zones online, many counter that a lack of guidelines highlights power dynamics existing in broader culture (Dunbar-Hester 2020).



> via [Elements of AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/1/1) "to list properties that are characteristic to AI, in this case autonomy and adaptivity. Autonomy: The ability to perform tasks in complex environments without constant guidance by a user. Adaptivity; The ability to improve performance by learning from experience.
> "When defining and talking about AI we have to be cautious as many of the words that we use can be quite misleading. Common examples are learning, understanding, and intelligence. [...]
