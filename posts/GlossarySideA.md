## Intersectional AI A-to-Z

This glossary of terms for Intersectional AI A-to-Z is a great place to get started. By all means it's only one example of definitions for these complex ideas, and it is meant as an open invitation for conversations and amendments! These concepts show the complexity of the topic seen from multiple angles; yet it is so important to try to break down these concepts into plain language in order to offer more openings for folks to join these conversations. Please chime in, ask questions, help make these definitions better!

#### autonomous agents
>"The ability to perform tasks in complex environments without constant guidance by a user," is a key quality of so-called self-driving cars, AI assistants, and certain manufacturing robotics that are increasingly popular in conversations on the future of AI—both its potentials and its pitfalls. That perceived autonomy is often considered a marker of a system's sophistication, but algorithmic systems are always socio-technical, meaning they are co-created with and embedded in cultural systems.

#### bias & variance
Bias is the 

#### confidence interval
>A range of numbers that helps describe how uncertain an estimate is. Any confidence interval has a high (e.g. 95%) chance of containing the true* value (that is, the accurate answer to the question being asked). So the bigger the interval, the more uncertain and the more doubt. Confidence intervals are used in statistics and in AI to determine a model (formula)'s reliability. *Classically presumes a hidden but "true" unknown value that is independent of the model (and this is not always the case of course). Unfortunately, uncertainty remains inherent in prediction and difficult to comprehend in models, even for researchers who create them.[^DataFeminism]

#### explainability


#### feature extraction
Features are the items in a model that its designers decide are relevant,

#### GANs
>GAN stands for generative adversarial network and is a lately-popular kind of machine learning used for image manipulation that gives what we're starting to think of as that "AI dreaming" aesthetic. It is created by using two ML models together, one trying to create images to meet the other's criteria, while the other tries to assess the accuracy of the first (hence adversaries).

#### X (as input) & Y (as output)
`y = f(x) + Σ` the simplest machine learning model looks like this. Written out it means that the output of a model is a function `f()` of the inputs `x` (which are also called parameters or features and are known) plus the error `Σ` (which is unknown). A function, here, just means that some calculation (algorithm, operation, recipe) is performed on the stuff inside `( )` based on what the model's creators have determined yields expected, "appropriate" results.
